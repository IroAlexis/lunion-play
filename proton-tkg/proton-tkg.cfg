# 'Wine-to-rule-them-all' - Proton-TkG simple config file

##
##   This config file contains the basic settings of your build.
##   For deeper configuration, see proton-tkg-profiles/advanced-customization.cfg
##

# This is a simplified config file with minimal comments. See ../wine-tkg-git/customization.cfg for more details.
# Some options will be missing from this config file compared to wine-tkg-git as they are enforced.

#### NON-MAKEPKG OPTIONS (Won't affect makepkg builds) ####

# Set to true to get a prompt after the 64-bit part is built, enabling package switching before building the 32-bit side.
# This is a workaround for distros shipping broken devel packages that can't coexist as multilib
_nomakepkg_midbuild_prompt="false"

# Set to the distro of your choice to attempt dependency resolution. Valid options are "debuntu" (for debian, ubuntu and similar), "fedora" or "archlinux".
_nomakepkg_dep_resolution_distro=""

# Strip libs for smaller footprint (--strip-unneeded) - Not recommended for debugging
_nomakepkg_strip="true"

# Set to true if you want to skip the uninstaller at the end of proton-tkg building
_skip_uninstaller="false"

# Set to true if you do not want your build to be automatically moved to your compatibilitytools.d dir
_no_autoinstall="false"

####

# Setting it to "true" will default to "release"
_use_dxvk="release"

# Set to false to add DXVK configuration support to Wine's DXGI, allowing for VKD3D to run while keeping DXVK dxgi functionalities.
# !! For DXVK to work properly with this option set to false, you'll need a DXVK build that comes with dxvk_config.dll !!
# Keep in mind Wine's dxgi can be more unstable and less compatible when used with DXVK.
_dxvk_dxgi="true"

# vkd3d - Explicitely enable vkd3d support for d3d12 to vulkan translation
# Valid options:
#  - "mainline" - To use with the deeply deprecated mainline/release version - https://source.winehq.org/git/vkd3d.git/
#  - "fork" - To use with HansKristian & Doitsujin vkd3d fork (used by Proton) - https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d - I'm offering a PKGBUILD for it here: https://github.com/Frogging-Family/vkd3d-git
#  - "false" - Disable explicit support
# !!! Requires either _dxvk_dxgi="false" (default) or to set PROTON_USE_WINE_DXGI=1 in your user_settings.py or as runtime env var !!!
# This will also add DXVK configuration support to Wine's DXGI
