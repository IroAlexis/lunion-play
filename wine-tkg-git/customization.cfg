# 'Wine-to-rule-them-all' - Wine-TkG simple config file

##
##   This config file contains the basic settings of your build.
##   For deeper configuration, see wine-tkg-profiles/advanced-customization.cfg
##

#### NON-MAKEPKG OPTIONS (Won't affect makepkg builds) ####

# Set to the desired installation path for your build(s). A versioned dir containing your build will be created inside that target.
# Example: _nomakepkg_prefix_path="/home/frog" will install your build in /home/frog/wine-tkg-********
_nomakepkg_prefix_path=""

# Set to true to get a prompt after the 64-bit part is built, enabling package switching before building the 32-bit side.
# This is a workaround for distros shipping broken devel packages that can't coexist as multilib
_nomakepkg_midbuild_prompt="false"


#### EXTERNAL INSTALLATION SETTINGS - !! ONLY AFFECTS MAKEPKG !! ####

# Set to true to install into external path instead of /usr. This allows you to install multiple different versions in parallel.
# !!! Don't forget that you'll have to use /opt/wine-something/bin/wine instead of just wine (same for winecfg etc.) !!!
_EXTERNAL_INSTALL="true"


#### WINE FLAVOUR SETTINGS ####

# plain wine commit or version tag if you want to use a specific wine version. Can use e.g. "64d9f30", "wine-3.16" or "wine-4.0"
# !!! Only affects non-staging builds (you want to edit the staging_version below for staging builds) !!!
# Leave empty to use latest master - https://github.com/wine-mirror/wine/commits/master
_plain_version=""

# staging
_use_staging="true"
# staging commit or version tag if you want to use a specific staging version. Can use e.g. "7cfceb7", "v3.16" or "v4.0"
# Leave empty to use latest master - https://github.com/wine-staging/wine-staging/commits/master
_staging_version=""

# esync - Enable with WINEESYNC=1 envvar - Set to true to enable esync support on plain wine or wine-staging <4.6 (it got merged in wine-staging 4.6). The option is ignored on wine-staging 4.6+
# You may need to raise your fd limits -> https://github.com/zfigura/wine/blob/esync/README.esync
_use_esync="true"

# fsync - Enable with WINEFSYNC=1 envvar - Set to true to enable fsync support, an experimental replacement for esync introduced with Proton 4.11-1 - Requires Wine Mainline 4.7.r168.g29914d583f / Staging 4.9.r7.g197e08b4 or newer
# https://steamcommunity.com/games/221410/announcements/detail/2957094910196249305
_use_fsync="true"

# vkd3d - Use the currently installed vkd3d packages (both 32 and 64-bit) for d3d12 to vulkan translation - If they aren't (both) installed, vkd3d won't be used
# !!! You need to use wine DXGI for VKD3D to work (remove your dxgi.dll override if any on the prefix you want to use VKD3D on, basically) !!!
_use_vkd3d="true"

# Set to false to add DXVK configuration support to Wine's DXGI, allowing for VKD3D to run while keeping DXVK dxgi functionalities.
# Keep in mind Wine's dxgi can be more unstable and less compatible when used with DXVK.
_dxvk_dxgi="true"
